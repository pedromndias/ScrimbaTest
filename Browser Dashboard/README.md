This is a browser dashboard chrome extension. It uses several fetches to API's so we get data back. One of them is for cryptocurrencies where we use the returned data's
parameters to display bitcoin price and 24h max and min. Another one gets an image from Unsplash and displays it together with its author. The third one uses our geolocation
to show our current city's temperature, also representing with an meteo icon. We also use the date.toLocaleTimeString() method to show the current time on the dashboard.
