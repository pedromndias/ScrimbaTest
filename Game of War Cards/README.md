This is a card game where each players gets a card from a deck until the deck finishes. I used a fetch to a play cards API so I can have a new deck each time I press a button on 
my app. There's another button to display the cards each time I draw 2 more (one for each player). Through a function I determine what's the highest card of the 2 and then 1 point
is added to the computer/player.
