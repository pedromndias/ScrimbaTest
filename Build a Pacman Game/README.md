This is a simple version of the pacman game. Through an event listener each time we press an arrow key pacman moves between the board walls (created with Javascript)
and the scores goes up eveytime a green dot is eaten. Ghosts are in the center and have also the hability to move in the board and the game is over if pacman touches one.
However, 4 power pellets are on the board to sum 10 points to the score and make the ghosts "scared" for 10 seconds, making it possible to touch the ghost, add 100 points
and send it back to the ghost center. Ghosts are created using Class and constructor.
