This is a snake game. I used 2 arrays (one for the grid and one for the snake) which allows me to update the current indexes with certain classes (make it a different color
to look like a snake). A random apple is generated and when the head of the snake hits the apple, we increase the size of the snake by one square, and the score by 1 point.
The game ends if the snake hits the walls or itself and a "Game Over" message is shown.
